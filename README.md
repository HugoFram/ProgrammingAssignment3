# This repository contains a run_analysis.R R script that performs
# all the transformations required to produced a tidy dataset from
# the Samsung data provided. To work, the working directory needs
# to be the root of the Samsung data set which is available at this
# URL: 
# http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# The repo also contains a codeBook.md text file that describes
# the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was
# performed to clean up the data.
